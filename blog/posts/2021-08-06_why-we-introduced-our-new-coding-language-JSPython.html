<p>I&rsquo;ve worked with a dozen programming languages during my career in software development.
        Anything from Basic, Pascal, C* to Python, JavaScript, and more. And here we are, fast forward 25 years and
        I had no other option than to invent another coding language. With all questions
        asking, &lsquo;why?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Do we want to learn another programming language? - No, Python is the most popular
        language in the world</p>

<p>Do we have time to rebuild libraries for all the needs? - No, JavaScript has huge
        communities and a huge EcoSystem around it.</p>

<p>We had a requirement to allow users to define custom logic at runtime safely. We
        tried a JSON-based configuration, but, as complexities grew, that configuration became unmaintainable. Even
        UI-based drag&rsquo;n drop interfaces become messy for bigger and more complex logic. And after a few failed
        attempts I decided to build my interpreter and introduce a new coding language to the world. And syntax-wise
        I choose to start with Python as it is the most familiar syntax among our target audience.</p>

<p><a href="https://jspython.dev">JSPython
        </a>is a python-like syntax interpreter implemented with javascript that runs entirely in
        the web browser and/or in the NodeJS environment. It does not transpile/compile your code into JavaScript,
        instead, it provides an interactive interpreter that reads Python-like code and carries out its
        instructions. With JSPython you should be able to safely interact with any JavaScript libraries or
        API&rsquo;s with the popular Python-like syntax.</p>

<p>With JSPython you can use any JavaScript library with Python-like syntax. You can use
        standard Javascript objects, arrays, callback functions, as well as build your custom logic with JavaScript
        and expose it to JSPython users</p>
<h2>Main advantages of JSPython</h2>
<ul>
        <li><b>Safe scripting environment.</b> You have full control over what
                functions and libraries you expose to JSPython and allow users to use.</li>
        <li><b>Works in a browser as well as offline on the server-side.</b> You can
                integrate it easily with your web app in the browser and/or run jspy files offline with
                jspython-cli in
                the NodeJS environment</li>
        <li><b>The python-like syntax.</b> Most of the language features (syntax,
                indentation, and expressions) are mirrored from Python. Also, added a few extras like Multiline
                lambdas,
                Null coalescing, single line conditions, etc</li>
        <li><b>Utilize the entire JavaScript ecosystem.</b> Leverage a massive
                JavaScript ecosystem with Python scripting. You should be able to import and invoke any JS
                function with
                the Python syntax</li>
        <li><b>Rapid Application Development.</b> The seamless interaction between
                Python and JavaScript allows developers to enjoy the best of two worlds. And deliver business
                solutions
                much quicker and more reliably.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Where to start?</h2>
<p>JSPython is an
        <a href="https://github.com/jspython-dev/jspython">open source JavaScript library</a>&nbsp;with a permissive BSD
        3-Clause License. Published to <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jspython-interpreter">npm as
                jspython-interpreter</a>
</p>
<h3>Run JSPython in your JavaScript App</h3>


<p>
<pre>npm install jspython-interpreter</pre>
</p>

<p>
<pre>
jsPython()
  .evaluate('print("Hello World!")')            
  .then(
    r => console.log("Result => ", r),            
    e => console.log("Error => ", error)            
  )
        </pre>

</p>

<h3>Run JSPython in NodeJS with JSPython-CLI</h3>

<p>Use <a href="https://github.com/jspython-dev/jspython-cli">JSPython-cli</a><span>&nbsp;command
                line tool what allows you to run JSPython in NodeJS environment</p>

<p>
<pre>jspython --file=path/to/jspython/file --param1=value --param</pre>
</p>

<h2>Any similar projects around?</h2>

<p>Obviously, before committing to such a big endeavour I&rsquo;ve looked around for existing
        libraries. The closest library is
        <a href="https://skulpt.org">Skulpt</a>&nbsp;but
        their API isn&rsquo;t flexible enough and we couldn&rsquo;t utilize our JavaScript libraries
</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>Many people are asking about performance and maturity of the project. How does it
        compare to Python performance-wise? </p>
<p>Well, it is very comparable to CPython, mainly because CPython is quite slow :), while
        Google&rsquo;s <a href="https://v8.dev">V8 JavaScript engine</a>&nbsp;is extremely optimized and
        performant. You will find
        that NodeJS will significantly outperform any CPython project. So, I can confidently say that JSPython
        is fast enough to serve most of your custom workflow and behaviour logic. And is already used in several
        performance critical production systems.</p>

<h2>Worksheet Systems</h2>
<p>
        JSPython was build to power our low code data management platform - <a
                href="https://worksheet.systems">Worksheet Systems</a>. Which allows anybody to build database
        applications with ease, control and confidence.
        JSPython is used as a primary low code language to define UI behaviours, validations, build data
        transformational pipelines and much more.
</p>
<p>However, it is open source project with <a href="https://github.com/jspython-dev/jspython/blob/DEV-v2/LICENSE">a
                permissive BSD 3-Clause License.</a>. So, feel free to adopt it into your own projects.</p>
