<p>It wasn’t too many years ago that ‘the cloud’ was purely a meteorological term. Nowadays it has been absorbed by a
  multitude of industries. The technical basis in which it is used may differ, but fundamentally, the cloud is a way to
  harness computing power on networked servers that can do the number-crunching and service delivery remotely, rather
  than having silicon chips and circuit boards sitting woefully under your desk or in your server room.</p>
<p>Having powerful systems working on your behalf means that services that may have previously been unfeasible for many
  people are now simply an internet connection away. So if that’s the cloud, what’s all this cloud data storage
  solutions all about?</p>
<p>The fact is, the IT world is changing fast and business are looking to leverage the flexibility of the cloud for
  their databases. Why? Read on.</p>
<h3>Collaboration </h3>
<p>Business of different sizes are being creative when it comes to storing their data. MS Excel has quickly become part
  and parcel of almost every company’s IT strategy and those wanting to utilise computing power that had previously been
  out of range. The truth is, Excel can still work its magic on the cells and numbers within it, but when it comes to
  collaboration and sharing and basic functional power, it falls way short. Unfortunately for Excel, these areas are
  fast becoming the number one priorities for many businesses.</p>
<p>Worksheet Systems’ focus, on the contrary, is collaboration and security. Data is stored in the cloud and therefore
  can be easily accessed by different team members from anywhere in the world. Data, tables and spreadsheets can be
  edited simultaneously saving the final draft in one place, rather than on two or more different machines. Moreover,
  all the changes made by the team member are tracked in what we call an audit trail. It includes all details on what
  has been changed, by who and at what time.</p>
<h3>Cost Effectiveness</h3>
<p>Customized database solution, cloud based or not, can cost a lot of money to implement. IT budgets are tight and
  often for smaller scale business, they are not even there. Worksheet Systems offers an alternative to an excel
  database, and takes collaboration and cost effectiveness at its forefront. Custom solutions to what we are proposing
  can be very expensive, but our unique answer is both cost effective and powerful enough to meet all your needs. Your
