<p>There are many good tools to access and work with relational databases. My favourite ones were MS SQL Management
    Studio and Azure Data Studio. However, several features can make exploring, analysing and working with SQL databases
    much better and easier.</p>
<p>We wanted to go a bit further, beyond a SQL query, beyond simple views or CRUD operations. We wanted to give people
    tools to leverage SQL robustness and power to allow anybody with fundamental data engineering skills (like citizen
    developers, business analysts, data analysts and even business people) a low code platform to make robust data
    management tasks much more straightforward.</p>
<p>We've introduced an online SQL client as a core part of WORKSHEETS Data Studio - our low code data management
    platform. Keeping your data in the database is fundamental to any data-centric IT solution.</p>
<p>WORKSHEETS Data Studio can be accessed in your browser straight away. So, to get started, you don't need anything to
    install.</p>

<h2>Short video intro</h2>

<div style="width: 100%;">
    <iframe width="100%" height="580" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cm56EZ-5bFc" title="YouTube video player"
        frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
        allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p> We have apparent features, like a tree with data objects, SQL editor with auto-complete, a result panel and
    everything else you can find in other conventional RMDB tools. However, I would like to highlight the following
    features:
</p>

<h2>Share and Collaborate</h2>

<p>Since WORKSHEETS Data Studio is a web (browser-based) tool, sharing and collaboration are native features. You can
    create appealing user stories and share them with the world with a single URL. A URL contains all your filters,
    sorting and columns and makes it very useful when you want to share a link. This will allow other people to see the
    same information as you see it. In addition, you can permit access to your database for individual users and groups
    or even grant public access.</p>

<h2>Easily navigate and search</h2>
<p>VSCode-inspired WORKSHEET Data Studio layout, and you'll find a lot of similarities, e.g. Tabs, Sidebar etc. However,
    the most incredible feature is a search box. A single textbox where you can find and navigate to any database object
    (table/view/stored procedure) within all databases you are connected to. So you don't have to click and scroll
    anymore. Just type in whatever you are looking for
</p>

<h2>Data Visualization and Data Analysis</h2>
<p>
    Once you have found your table/view, you can see data in the excel-like data grids and even plot charts for quick
    exploratory data analysis and modifications.
</p>

<h3>Excel-like filter for each column.</h3>
<p>By default, we are showing only the first 1000 rows (you can remove this restriction). So, you can use your filters
    for each column. Here are two useful features:
<ul>
    <li>A unique list of values</li>
    <li>You can workout either this column is unique or not
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    All filters added up and a summary is shown in the bottom left corner
</p>
<p>

        title="SQL Data Api Components diagram">
<p>From the picture above, you can tell that the table SampleSupersureSales has 8,399 rows. And you can see 821 rows
    WHERE Customer Segment is 'Small Business' or 'Consumer' and Product Category equal 'Technology'. Also, from the
    header filter (like in excel), you can find a breakdown of 21 countries.
</p>
</p>
</p>

<h3>Join tables together</h3>
<p>We know how important it is to combine pieces of information and get a holistic data view. You can effortlessly join
    or extend tables even if you don't have DDL access. Just use a visual editor. Then effortlessly share with your
    colleagues or customers with a simple URL
</p>
<p>
    You can use a visual Query Manager to join tables/views, select columns from a joined table and specify field
    expressions if needed.
</p>
<p>
    <img style="max-width: 100%" alt="Query Manager" src="assets/img/posts/online-sql-client-03.PNG"
        title="Query Manager">
</p>

<p>
    Then, from the visual query designer, you can generate SQL Query or JSPython code with SQL-Data-API.</p>
<p>
    <img style="max-width: 100%" alt="Context Menu" src="assets/img/posts/online-sql-client-04.PNG"

<p>
    Generated SQL Code will look like

    <img class="w-100" alt="Generated SQL Code" src="assets/img/posts/online-sql-client-05.PNG"
        title="Generated SQL Code">
</p>
<p>Or you can easily plot any table data into a graph for better visibility and storytelling.</p>
<p>
    <img class="w-100" alt="Graph Data" src="assets/img/posts/online-sql-client-06.PNG" title="Graph Data">
</p>

<h3>Linked Views</h3>
<p>
    Joining, filtering and customising your data is an essential data exploration practice. However, sometimes you need
    to provide a comprehensive view of data. So, you can filter data in the connected views in other browsers.
</p>
<p> <img class="w-100" alt="Linked Views" src="assets/img/posts/online-sql-client-07.PNG" title="Linked Views">
</p>
<p>
    This picture shows that the left-side browser can control/filter data in 3 other browsers. This everyday use case
    explores master details data or other dependencies.
</p>

<h2>Import from excel or files</h2>
<p>As part of WORKSHEETS Data Studio, you can leverage a low code programming language, JSPython or several UI tools to
    comprehensively import data from files or other systems and map them to the table fields.</p>

<h2>Access your Database via REST API</h2>
<p>Your SQL Database will be available through RESTfull API for better integration. In addition, we have open source
    libraries for JSPython, JavaScript, C# and Python.
</p>
<p> <img class="w-100" alt="SQL Data Api Components diagram" src="assets/img/posts/online-sql-client-01.PNG"
        title="SQL Data Api Components diagram">
</p>
<p>
    SQL Data API is a central access point to control access to your databases through a REST API (https). Here is a <a
        href="https://github.com/FalconSoft/sql-data-api-client-js"> SQL Data Api JavaScript client</a> or <a
        href="https://run.worksheet.systems/data-studio/app/PublicData/SqlDataApiTesting?file=app.jspy"> JSPython test
        harnesses</a>
</p>

<h2>Role-Based Access Control</h2>
<p>On top of existing SQL Security, we add another layer to securely control access to your database for authorised
    users or public access.</p>

<h2>In the cloud or on-premise</h2>
<p>The Enterprise version is available for your own servers or in a private/public cloud.</p>

<h2>One tool many databases</h2>
<p>We are aiming to support all relational databases. We currently have the full support of MS SQL, AzureSQL and
    PostgreSQL (beta). But, we are going to add MySQL, Oracle etc.</p>

<h2>SQL Data-Driven Workflow</h2>
<p>Automate and streamline SQL Data-Driven Workflow and custom ETL pipelines.</p>

<h2>Excel plug-in</h2>
<p><a href="https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-gb/product/office/WA104381608?tab=Overview">WORKSHEETS Data Studio
        AddIn</a> provides a flexible and controlled way to access and store your spreadsheet data to and from SQL
    Database
