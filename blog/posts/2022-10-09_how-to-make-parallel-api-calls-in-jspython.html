    It is quite a common scenario when you have to make multiple an API calls in parallel. Making parallel calls will
    reduce the latency and improve the performance of your solution. Either you are looking to speed up a data loading
    process
    or perform some sort of load/stress testing. <br />
</p>
<p>In Javascript, you can spin up multiple `Promises` and then use the function <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all"
        target="blank">Promise.all()</a>
    to wait for all of them to succeed. Or you can use RxJS, streams or controlled callbacks</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.jspython.dev/" target="blank">JSPython</a> was designed to evaluate all instructions
    synchronously.

    Mainly because of simplicity, it looks like Python users - data engineers and analysts don't like the complexity
    that comes with <i>Promises</i>, <i>Streams</i>
    or <i>callbacks</i>.
    JSPython awaits/resolves all promises at its core. So, you won't have any <i>Promise</i> anywhere in the JSPython
    runtime
    (apart from some edge cases).
</p>
<p>
    So, how to run code parallel, then?<br /> The answer is <a href="https://rxjs.dev/guide/overview"
        target="blank">RxJs</a>. You can
    use RxJs functions to
    create observable sequences, then combine response values they emitted (with forkJoin) and convert them back to
    <i>Promise</i> (which will be automatically evaluated in JSPython)
</p>


<p>The following JSPython code shows this approach in action. This example makes five parallel requests and returns an
    array of responses along with the corresponding requestId</p>
<pre>
    from 'rxjs' import forkJoin, lastValueFrom, map

    ids = [2, 7, 4, 9, 5]

    httpRequests$ = ids
        .map(
            requestId => httpRequest$("GET", "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/" + requestId)
                                                .pipe(
                                                    map(r => {requestId, response: r.data})
                                                )
        )

    return lastValueFrom(forkJoin(httpRequests$))        
</pre>

<p>Let's go through the code.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Import RxJs functions</li>
    <li>Create an array of <i>ids</i>.</li>
    <li>Use <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_map.asp">map function</a> to transform an array of <i>ids</i>
        into
        an array of Observables.</li>
    <li>Use the <b>httpRequest$</b> function to fetch data from a server. The asynchronous <i>built-in</i> function
        sends an HTTP request, and returns an Observable
        that emits the requested data when the response is received.</li>
    <li>Then we use <a href="https://www.learnrxjs.io/learn-rxjs/operators/transformation/map"
            target="blank">observable's
            pipe(map(...))</a> and transform result, by adding a requestId and response
    </li>

    <li>Then we wait for all observables to complete and combine responses in the array. We use <a
            href="https://www.learnrxjs.io/learn-rxjs/operators/combination/forkjoin" target="blank">forkJoin</a> for
        this</li>

    <li>Then convert observable into <i>Promise</i> with function <a
            href="https://rxjs.dev/api/index/function/lastValueFrom" target="blank">lastValueFrom</a>. Then, JSPython
        natively resolves
        <i>Promise</i> into a synchronous result
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Sequential vs. Parallel API Calls</h2>

<p>
    In another example, I want to show two different functions where one of them <b>run_Sequential</b> is making https
    requests
    sequential and function <b>run_Parallel</b> is doing same things
    but in parallel
</p>

<pre>
    from 'rxjs' import forkJoin, lastValueFrom, map

    ids = [2, 7, 4, 9, 5]
    
    async def run_Sequential():
        data = []
    
        for requestId in ids:
            response = httpGet("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/" + requestId)
            data.push({requestId, response})
    
        return data
    
    async def run_Parallel():
        httpRequests$ = ids
            .map(
                requestId => httpRequest$("GET", "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/" + requestId)
                                                    .pipe(
                                                        map(r => {requestId, response: r.data})
                                                    )
            )
    
        return lastValueFrom(forkJoin(httpRequests$))
       
    if __env.entryFunction == '':
        return {
                sequential: run_Sequential(),
                parallel: run_Parallel()
            }
    
</pre>
