<h3>What are you looking for in spreadsheet programs?</h3>
<p>Spreadsheets have become an integral part in today&#8217;s corporate climate. They are often considered a short-term
  solution to fill the gaps that exist between companies needs and systems&#8217; capabilities. In reality, spreadsheet
  programs are embedded in business processes and used for many years. Therefore, effective use of spreadsheets have
  become a key focus for enhancing compliance.</p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">For a long time, Excel had the world of spreadsheet all to its self and it is still the widely
    used spreadsheet program on the market. It can manipulate large sets of data, run powerful queries, perform
    sophisticated calculations ’s and many more complex data manipulation tasks. With the rise of the revolutionary
    &#8216;cloud&#8217;, collaboration features and capabilities are climbing up the requirements list. Excel&#8217;s
    time is in doubt. </span></p>
<h3>Google Sheets Advantages</h3>
<p>The basic concept of spreadsheets in the cloud is appealing. In reality, Google Spreadsheets, offering a cloud
  spreadsheet alternative, is nowhere near the modelling capabilities Excel has to offer. However, Sheets are serving a
  very different audience and purpose. It&#8217;s main focus is on supporting operational processes where a team of
  people is involved in. Examples include customer lists, marketing lists, inventories and any other list you can think
  off. Below are Google Sheets advantages explained in more detail.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cloud.</strong> With Google Sheets, like any cloud-based system, the big advantage is that the information
    is stored and backed-up on servers, rather than your local machines. This means that your work is always available,
    providing you have an internet connection. Working with your team being a world apart is no longer an obstacle and
    in fact, promotes team-work and effectiveness.</li>
  <li><strong>Collaboration.</strong> If you have never used Google Sheets within your team, you probably should start
    exploring it. It is very easy to work with multiple people on one spreadsheet simultaneously. You can even see what
    cells are currently blocked for editing! Building and updating customer details, creating and assigning to do tasks
    and storing inventory data are just a few examples.</li>
  <li><strong>Ease of use. </strong>No prior training is required to start using Sheets. If you have ever worked with
    spreadsheet program, Google Sheets will be all easy-peasy. Open up the spreadsheet and start building up data or
    continue where your colleagues have left off. It&#8217;s that simple.</li>
  <li><strong>Free. </strong>Google Sheets comes absolutely free and doesn&#8217;t form part of a package which you do
    have to pay for. If it doesn&#8217;t full full your needs, at least your tried.</li>
  <li><strong>Integration with Google product. </strong>Google Sheets is part of the bigger family of Google products.
    Seamingless integration with Docs, Drive and Calendar makes your life that little bit easier.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Google Sheets Disadvantages</h3>
<div>
  <p>When you start to push, even just a little bit, the boundaries of what you want Sheets to do, its shortcomings
    become very clear. Not only are its data modelling techniques poor, when you want to start using it as a database,
    data integrity becomes a problem. This and a few other drawbacks are discussed below:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Data Integrity. </strong>Consistent, accurate and complete data is a critical aspect to any system or
      software that deals with your data. In broader sense, data is there to provide insights, but with lack of
      consistency (primary and foreign keys), accuracy and completeness (validation controls) your data becomes useless.
      You loose the ability to trace and connect data, recover or search and it is is more prone to mistakes.
      Unfortunately, Google Sheets places very little emphasis on &#8216;data integrity&#8217;. If your aim is to build
      data sets to make business decisions on, stay away from Google Sheets. At least for now.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Security. </strong>Security is increasingly our number one priority when it comes to our data and
      online storage. Your data needs to be more secure than a simple login can allow, particularly if your data is of
      sensitive nature. Unfortunately, this is as good as it get with Google Sheets. Sheets do not employ the following
      practices which ensure data security: <ul>
        <li>Data backups</li>
        <li>User permissions</li>
        <li>Validation controls (for invalid or duplicated data)</li>
        <li>Data encryption</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Data Structure. </strong>When you’re dealing with a ‘basic’ package like Sheets, you’re going to be
      limited to what you can ask of it. Data structure is one of them. It is a way of organising your data in an
      efficient way so it can be used later for multiple purposes. Sheets allows you to input data anywhere, in any cell
      without any logic or validation steps. Database softwares should be aimed to help you to organise your data.
      Unfortunately Google Sheets doesn&#8217;t. It is too easy to populate a spreadsheet with invalid, duplicated data
      without you ever knowing it.</li>
  </ul>
