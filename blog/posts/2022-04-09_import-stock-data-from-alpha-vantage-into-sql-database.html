<p>In this post, we will go over a tutorial guide on how you can use WORKSHEETS Data Studio to import historical stock
    data from Alpha Vantage API into the SQL database. We will cover 4 main topics
<ul>
    <li>How to use Alpha Vantage API to pull historical data</li>
    <li>Transform raw data into a readable data format, ready to be stored into the database or exported into the Excel
    </li>
    <li>Create an SQL table and load stock data in the table
    </li>
    <li>Setup a Scheduled Task to run this daily</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>We will use WORKSHEETS Data Studio to cover all these topics above.</p>

<h3>How to use Alpha Vantage API to pull historical data</h3>
<p>Alpha Vantage provides enterprise-grade financial market data through a set of powerful and developer-friendly APIs.
    From traditional asset classes (e.g., stocks and ETFs) to economic signals, from foreign exchange rates to
    cryptocurrencies, from fundamental data to technical indicators, Alpha Vantage is your one-stop-shop for real-time
    and historical global market data delivered through RESTful stock APIs
</p>
<p>If you explore <a href="https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#daily">Alpha Vantage API documentation</a>. You
    will find out, that you can pull historical timeseries stock data with HTTP GET call:
    <br /><br />

    Create a new App/Project in WORKSHEETS Data Studio and add a new JSPython file and use httpGet method for it. Then,
    press the RUN button to get the following results
</p>

        title="HTTP GET Alpha Vantage Historical Data">
</p>

<p>As you can see the output format is not necessarily the most convenient format that can be easily consumed by popular
    tools like Excel</p>

<h3>Transform raw data into a readable data format</h3>

<p>Next, we will show how you can transform a raw Alpha Vantage stock data into a more readable format, which can be
    stored in the SQL data table or imported into the Excel
</p>
<p>
    <img class="w-100" alt="Data Engineering" src="assets/img/posts/import-av-data-02-transform.png"
        title="Transform Alpha Vantage Historical Data">
</p>
<p>This JSPython script transformed Alpha Vantage historical stock data into a more readable format, which can be
    exported into the Excel or SQL Database table</p>

<h3>Create SQL table and load stock data in the table</h3>
<p>
    Before you can load data into the database, you have to have an existing database connection in your Worksheet
    Systems account. <a href="https://docs.worksheet.systems/docs/online-sql-client/connect-to-sql-database">Here is
        more info on how to do it</a>
</p>
<p>
    <img class="w-100" alt="Save To Database" src="assets/img/posts/import-av-data-03-save.png"
        title="Save To Database">
</p>
<p>
    Then, on the top right corner of the result panel, there is a menu item `Save To Database`.Click it to open a Save
    To Database dialog. Where you have to define:
<ul>
    <li>Table Name (make sure `Create New Table` checkbox is ON)</li>
    <li>Set Primary Keys. In this particular case, We will make a `date` and `symbol` a primary keys</li>
</ul>

Then press `Upsert(merge) Data` button that will create a new SQL table and will load all data into the SQL database.
</p>

<h3>Setup a Scheduled Task to run this daily</h3>
<p>
    And last but not least step is to set up a Scheduled Task that will run this JSPython script daily. This step will
    ensure your table is updated regularly and you have always up-to-date stock prices for your symbols. It is very easy
    to do with WORKSHEETS Data Studio. All you have to do is press `Schedule Task` set a time you want to run and press
    `Save` button.
</p>
<p>Before doing this, you have to make sure your scripts can work without any user interactions. So, we have to write a
    JSPython script that will save historical data. Here is example:
</p>
<pre>
    # stockData is an array of stock data items
    sqlDataApi("SQL-Shared")
        .save("test1.AVStockData", stockData)  
</pre>

<p>
    Also, you have to grant permissions to the `ScheduledTasksRunner` user
</p>
