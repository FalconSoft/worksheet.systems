<p class="dropcap">Today we are proud to announce the launch of <a href="https://worksheet.systems"> Worksheet
    Systems </a>, a online databases software that allows businesses to manage and share their data effectively.</p>
<h3>Why did we create Worksheet Systems?</h3>
<p>Every business has unique data that it needs to work with to provide its services, support its employees, and inform
  its customers, yet not all businesses have access to software solutions that allow them to manage and use that data
  effectively and securely.</p>
<p>In our experience, many businesses struggle to manage and use their data effectively to support their employees and
  customers. Popular data tools, such as Microsoft Excel, lack the data structure, permissioning, and security features
  necessary to provide an effective data solution.</p>
<p>This leaves businesses open to data errors, which are not only time-consuming and expensive but can also lead
  businesses open to problems if their data is audited. A custom development is an effective option, but budget often
  makes this an unrealistic option for many businesses.</p>
<p>In response to this we have created a solution that supports businesses, no matter how complex their data
  requirements are. By providing a data solution that offers permissioning and security features, as well as a proper
  data structure, we help our customers maintain the integrity of their data without compromising their budget.<br />
  Through providing a <a href="https://worksheet.systems/pricing/">Free plan</a>, we hope to allow even the smallest
  of businesses and startups to access our tools. This also means your customers and colleagues can <a
    href="https://run.worksheet.systems">sign up</a> to see your data at no cost. <pp>
