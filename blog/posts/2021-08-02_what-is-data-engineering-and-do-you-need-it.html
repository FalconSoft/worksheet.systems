<h2 id="what-is-data-engineering">What Is Data Engineering?</h2>
<p>Data engineering is the process of gathering, structuring, and analyzing data for
    business purposes. Since data is a valuable resource for any kind of business, it needs to be organized in a
    way that can be used to make trustworthy business decisions. To do this, you need software engineers (data
    engineers), who are responsible for preparing and managing data on behalf of the business. &nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the role becomes difficult once the business&rsquo;s operation size increases.
    Sometimes, larger amounts of data means hiring more engineers to build a complex data engineering
    process.</p>
<h3>Roles of Data Engineering</h3>
<p>To get the best utility from data engineering, you have to understand the skills required to do
    the job. Without understanding the roles of data engineers, you can&rsquo;t create a successful data
    collection and structure project for your business. After reading the
    following roles, you might have an understanding of how you should approach data engineering.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Small Generalist Team: You can
        hire a small team of generalist data engineers to do
        the job.&nbsp;A general data engineer only compiles
        data and evaluates it for final users. Mostly, small businesses hire this type of engineer when
        they
        have to maintain a small database. </li>
    <li>Pipeline-Centric: Small and medium-sized companies
        hire pipeline-centric engineers for their businesses. This sort of company has more complex data to
        compile and study. The team consists of two or more data scientists where a data engineer has expertise
        in the data distribution system and computer science. Sometimes, they have to create a tool on which
        data scientists&nbsp;can run metadata with efficient
        algorithms.</li>
    <li>Database-Centric: A database-centric engineer is
        usually found in big companies with a vast amount of data. This
        sort of engineer mainly works to configure a database system that is very fast in both understanding and
        transporting. This requires an ETL (Extracting, Transforming, Loading) data process. Database-centric
        engineers have a good number of data analytics and researchers on their teams.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="main-functions-of-data-engineering">Main Functions of Data Engineering</h2>
<p>Having decided on the roles of data engineering you need for your business, let&rsquo;s have a
    look at its major functions. </p>
<h3>Structuring Raw Data</h3>
<p>The entire process of data engineering starts by collecting and structuring raw data.
    But what is raw data? Raw data is the unstructured information your business generates in the form of
    unstructured numbers, text, images, sounds, videos, etc. For example, your business generates raw customer
    data like names, addresses, phone numbers, and more. When a data engineer classifies the raw data, it
    becomes logical.</p>
<p>After organizing the data, it becomes accessible and useful to your business.
    However, the organization of a small business&rsquo;s raw data can be easily done using Excel or SQL
    databases. So, whether you need a data engineer for that is questionable. Even for large businesses, raw
    versions of data can be contained using various tools.</p>
<h3>Developing Pipelines</h3>
<p>When you need to access your stored data and utilize it in real time, you need a pipeline
    system. This system starts with collecting the raw data from the SaaS platform (e.g., CRM tool, email
    marketing tool). Then the data is compiled to store in data warehouses so that data scientists can analyze
    it with analytic tools to answer questions such as how to increase the sale of unpopular products. This data
    can be a list of users who purchased your product this month, their ages, preferences, etc. A data
    pipeline&nbsp;consists of four factors:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sources of data</li>
    <li>Reading from the source</li>
    <li>Filtering the data</li>
    <li>Sending the data to a data warehouse or data lake</li>
</ul>
<h3>Assessing Business Goals</h3>
<p>This function requires organizing business data so that a company can meet its goals within the
    shortest possible time. Data engineers focus&nbsp;on
    designing algorithms in an efficient way, making analytics much easier. However, certain tools can give
    accurate results and help companies provide effective decision-making for business goals.</p>
<h3>Demonstrating Data Trends</h3>
<p>Data engineering&nbsp;positions can be different based on the
    organization. Sometimes, they have to work as analysts for the company. They evaluate the data to find
    trends of an outcome and interpret the results to the top management. The results could be a business
    forecast, previous history, business value, profit margins, etc.</p>
<h3>Constructing Data Models</h3>
<p>Engineers have to create models to interpret the results of information about your
    business. They have to ensure the data is clean and ready to use. Figures and models of your venture are
    used by the engineers to forecast and create effective data models.</p>
<h3>Developing Algorithms</h3>
<p>Data engineers develop algorithms that ensure the data pipeline is smooth for the
    analytics team. Logical searches and transporting data to different sections all are based on
    algorithms.</p>
<h3>Developing Tools</h3>
<p>Data engineers can develop customized analytical tools according to your
    business&rsquo;s requirements. They can also develop customized data collection tools using C++, Java, or
    other programming languages. </p>
<h3>Collaborating with Project Participants</h3>
<p>Data engineers work as a team along with your data scientists. They can manage your
    whole analytics team in an efficient and productive way. They can also carry out your team with customized
    data pipelines and algorithms for your projects.</p>
<h2 id="when-you-should-implement-data-engineering">When You Should Implement Data Engineering</h2>
<p>Previously, organizations depended on data
    engineers&nbsp;to compile and illustrate big data.
    Over time, many programs were developed to make it easier for the analytics team.
    Therefore, it became quite possible to get the same result using modern software tools.
</p>
<p>If your business requires the analysis of huge amounts of data,
    having an understanding of data engineering functions and checking out data engineer hiring costs is
    recommended. There are several key factors indicating that you require data engineering services:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You have three data scientists in your business analytics
        team.</li>
    <li>You have 50 active users in your Business Intelligence
        platform.</li>
    <li>Your biggest table in the data warehouse hits one billion
        rows.</li>
    <li>Your organization requires custom data pipelines&nbsp;and there are
        three or more to build. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="things-to-check-when-searching-for-a-specialist">Things to Check When Searching for a Specialist</h2>
<p>When you decide to employ a specialist for your team, you should think about a couple
    of aspects according to your needs. Hiring a specialist based on your organization&rsquo;s size and budget
    is imperative.</p>
<h3>Skill Sets of a Data Engineer</h3>
<p>Engineers require a combination of skills consisting of engineering knowledge, data
    expertise, and database systems. A brief idea of their skill set is given below.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Engineering Knowledge: Data engineers must know
        the programming languages&nbsp;used in the system. The
        usual languages are Python, Java, C#, and Scala.</li>
    <li>Expertise in Data: They are required to
        work in a team where knowledge of algorithms and modeling comes in handy. The ETL process and managing
        the platforms is compulsory to work with other data scientists. They also need expertise in BI tools and
        data science and analysis.</li>
    <li>Database Systems: A specialist designs
        data storage and builds the entire system. They perform SQL queries on the database to extract necessary
        data. Database expertise also requires knowledge in other popular tools like Oracle, Panoply, and
        Redshift.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Data Engineer Payroll</h3>
<p>The salary depends on data engineering skills,
    experience, and location. </p>
<p>Thus, in the UK, an engineer earns up to &pound;72,000. According to some job sites,
    the payroll range is between &pound;40,351 to &pound;72,000 annually. In Germany, the salary averages
    &pound;52,600 annually, whereas in Singapore it&rsquo;s &pound;37,000, and in the USA, it&rsquo;s
    &pound;78,000.</p>
<h2 id="#alternative-to-hiring-a-data-engineer">Alternative to Hiring a Data Engineer:&nbsp;Create Database
    Applications</h2>
<p>A database application is a program that retrieves information from a database. By
    using a database application, you can easily store, collect and modify business data in a customized
    database without the need for a data engineer. </p>
<p>So, if you don&rsquo;t need to hire a data engineering team or person, then database
    applications are the best ways to get started with your data management process. Moreover, data security,
    customization, and flexibility are services every business is looking for from database applications.
