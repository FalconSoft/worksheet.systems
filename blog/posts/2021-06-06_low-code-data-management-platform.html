<p>After spending many years working for the financial services industry in various positions inside
  custom software development teams. I realized that the main pain point is a lack of rapid data management tools,
  making it easy for anyone to store information, visualise their data and automate workflows from a single
  place</p>

<p>Quite often, custom software teams can&rsquo;t cope &nbsp;with ever changing
  requirements. As a result, business users (usually tech savvy) turn to Excel, some bits of Python and SQL in order
  to automate and improve their data management workflows. With respect to the business users we worked with, most
  of them are super smart and intelligent people, they don&rsquo;t know how to write maintainable, well architected,
  robust and scalable software. That is why their excel &ldquo;systems&rdquo; always fall short. And over time,
  these &ldquo;systems&rdquo; become unmaintainable, unreliable and often do not accurately produce vital
  figures.</p>

<p>The solution to the problem is a SQL centric low code data management platform that allows business users
  and IT professionals&nbsp;to rapidly iterate and produce custom solutions in
  a streamlined and scalable way.</p>

<p>As a first step we started with improving tooling infrastructure around SQL server
  databases. Making sure that anybody can easily access data, manage access controls and modify/load data easily
  while maintaining data integrity and consistency.</p>

<h3>SQL Data Api - RESTful API for data access and manipulation
</h3>
<p>SQL Data Api allows you to easily expose your SQL Server data over to internet /
  intranet users. You can use RESTful API for data access and manipulation. This can be used for the sharing and
  collaboration of any kind of data and is supported in a number of data-related applications and technologies. You
  can permission other applications or custom workflow to consume your SQL Server with C#, Python, JavaScript open
  source libraries</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/FalconSoft/sql-data-api-client-Python">Source Code for Python SQL Data Api Client on
      GitHub</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/FalconSoft/sql-data-api-client-dotNet">Source Code for C# SQL Data Api Client on
      GitHub</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/FalconSoft/sql-data-api-client-js">Source Code for JavaScript SQL Data Api Client on
      GitHub</a></li>
</ul>



<h3>JSPython - building custom workflows</h3>
<p>Obviously, you can always drag &lsquo;n drop boxes around and build simple logic. But,
  in no time you will hit a wall and your custom logic will become unmaintainable. To solve this, we created a
  Python interpreter - <a href="https://jspython.dev">JSPython</a>. Your custom scripts can securely run in the browser,
  and at the same time you can
  run it server side with NodeJS. We choose Python&rsquo;s syntax as it is the most popular and friendly programming
  language. And we combined it with a rich JavaScript ecosystem, So, you can call any JavaScript library with
  Python-like syntax (including asynchronous promises, RxJS etc). Check out the open source project</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jspython-dev/jspython">Source Code on GitHub</a></p>


<h3>Data Visualization and UX</h3>
<p>Although, we believe that user business users should be able to explore (if
  permissioned) databases themselves. Sometimes, we need to give them a better user experience, like: interactive
  dashboards that combine multiple data sources or more robust data collection / user input forms with build-in
  validation and transformation logic. For that purpose, we&rsquo;ve built another open source library -
  <a href="https://falconsoft.github.io/ngx-dynamic-components/">ngx-dynamic-components.</a> That eventually is bundled
  with Bootstrap (the world&rsquo;s most popular front-end open
  source toolkit) and JSPython.
</p>
<p>

</p>

<h3>Data processing / Data wrangling</h3>
<p>Although, JSPython exposes all array and object manipulation functions from JavaScript.
  That wasn&#39;t enough. So, we created an open source library - <a href="https://datapipe-js.com/">datapipe-js</a>.
  dataPipe-JS is a data manipulation
  and data processing library for JavaScript. Inspired mainly &nbsp;from LINQ (C#) and Pandas (Python) and carefully
  brought into the JavaScript world. This provides a powerful API for data loading, data transformation and other
  helpful data manipulation functions.</p>

<h2>Worksheets Data Studio IDE and run-time</h2>

<p>You should look at Worksheet Systems as of two parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Worksheets Data Studio</b> - is a developer friendly online IDE and a set of reusable open source
    libraries for data engineers, business analysts or software developers. You can use our online IDE as well as VS
    Code and &nbsp;keep your source code in the source control of your choice </li>
  <li><b>Worksheet Systems - <i>run-time.</i></b> All
    applications that you&rsquo;ve built with our low code data management platform, can run as a stand-alone web
    app or scheduled batch job on a NodeJS server</li>
</ul>

<h2>Worksheets Data Studio - Online IDE</h2>
<p>Worksheets Data Studio is your ultimate online IDE for all your data management tasks,
  building custom apps and sharing/collaborating SQL databases. Core components being:</p>

<h3>Online SQL Client </h3>
<p>Connect to any of your SQL databases on-premises and in the cloud, Which enables multi
  user collaboration, advanced querying, exploring and modifying data. That will allow you to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Quickly find a database table/view/stored procedure of your
    interest</li>
  <li>Use advanced Excel-like data filters with useful information of rows
    count, groups etc.</li>
  <li>Create Custom Data Queries. You don&rsquo;t always want (or
    don&rsquo;t have permissions) to create a SQL View, stored procedures or write complicated queries in the SQL
    Server database. So, you can create a query and save it separately, share or collaborate with your friends,
    colleagues or clients</li>
  <li>We made modifying your data in the SQL table easy. We&rsquo;ve built
    a number of useful features to modify data in your database. (e.g. bulk edit, foreign fields, import/merge from
    excel etc)</li>
  <li>Import data with a smart merge feature that ensures control and
    consistency over your data</li>
  <li>Once you connected to your database, you can consume your SQL through
    a secure RESTFull service and we have built Python, C#, JavaScript or JSPython SQL Data Api clients for
    you</li>
  <li>Sharing and collaboration is as easy as passing a URL to your
    colleague or client.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Custom Scripting</h3>
<p>Use JSPython - a custom scripting language to process data, automate workflow or
  integrate with other systems</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Worksheets CLI</b> - command line interface to
    work with Worksheet Systems content offline - VS Code or keep it in the source control (GitHub, Bitbucket
    etc)</li>
  <li><b>JSPython CLI</b> - command line interface torun your JSPython scripts in the NodeJS
</ul>
<h3>Custom Apps and Interactive Dashboards</h3>
<p>Build interactive dashboards or input forms with our bootstrap based dynamic components
  library.</p>
<p>

</p>

<h2>Who should use it</h2>
<p>Our audience usually falls into the following roles:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Software Developers.</b> There is no need to
    follow ever changing JavaScript frameworks and tools. We&rsquo;ve got you covered. You can leverage well
    documented Bootstrap based libraries for web design and layout and use JSPython scripting facilities for your
    data processing and custom workflow development</li>
  <li><b>Data Analysts / Business Analysts.</b> We offer a
    rich set of exploratory data analysis features to stay on top of your data engineering workload</li>
  <li><b>Business Users.</b> We enable those who deeply
    understand business processes and workflows to contribute (or even build themselves) to the custom data
    management solutions. There is no need to understand underlying technologies when you need to craft an
    interactive dashboard or create a custom input form that fits well into your particular workflow, and share to
    collaborate. Or, you can simply benefit from the exploratory data analysis features we offer</li>
</ul>
