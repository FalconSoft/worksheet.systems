As a result, business users (usually tech savvy) turn to Excel, some bits of Python and SQL in order to automate and improve their data management workflows. With respect to the business users we worked with, most of them are super smart and intelligent people, they don’t know how to write maintainable, well architected, robust and scalable software. That is why their excel “systems” always fall short. And over time, these “systems” become unmaintainable, unreliable and often do not accurately produce vital figures. The solution to the problem is a SQL centric low code data management platform that allows business users and IT professionals to rapidly iterate and produce custom solutions in a streamlined and scalable way."

Used by millions of individuals and businesses, the spreadsheet software from Microsoft has been used for everything from to-do lists and project planning, to financial calculations, managing inventory, and much, much more. In fact, if you can think of a business or personal task that uses data, someone, somewhere, has probably used Excel to do it. Jack of All Trades – Master of None?? Despite its versatility, Excel has its drawbacks, many of which stem from users trying to use it for functions it is not suitable for. While it is true that Excel is great for manipulating data, it is still unsuitable for many data tasks, especially in businesses that need to collaborate effectively. These shortcomings have been highlighted by the recent explosion in popularity of cloud services, and the resulting impact on current business. As a tool to share and collaborate data it has a number of shortcomings, and in an age of digital crime its lack of security features can be a significant problem."
